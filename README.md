Calculator in 30 lines with gui using python and ttkbootstrap with innovative logic
main logic

1) we don't need separte functions to solve calculations for different functions we can use eval() function which will solve the expresion by converting it from a string to mathematical  expression.

2) we use exec function to create variables and buttons at runtime by combining it with string formating.
